## how it was done:
	* A helper class "minesweeper-game.class.ts" was created to ease the manipulation of the game logic within the Angular component
	* Implemented the use of interface to treat the cells as an Object (OOP)
	* Single Angular component to read the user inputs and pass them to the Minesweeper class.
